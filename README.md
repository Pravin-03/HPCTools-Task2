# HPCTools-Task2

In the file "baseline.c", you will find a method to resolve an equation of the form "AX=B", using QR decomposition, and more particularly Given's rotation matrix. However, for a reason I don't know, the QR_givens in the main code doesn't change Q and R, but we can see with a printf that in the code QR_givens Q and R are changed. So this code doesn't work yet because of this problem.

In the pdf named "task2", you will find table with different options with several times execution, for a small matrix, a medium matrix and then a large matrix.

For the teacher using Aula.cesga and who will evaluate me: As I wrote it in task1, I rewrote the code. Indeed, for the task1, I gave you a code in c++, but you asked a code in c. When I was going to put my file saturday, I saw the error so I rewrote the code in c. However, as written, the code in c doesn't work yet on the contrary to the first code. I execute the code in c, in order to obtain those values in task2. Sorry to be so late, it was in order to give something good (but still it doesn't work yet).
Good reading.
